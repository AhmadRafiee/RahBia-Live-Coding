### ðŸ”´ Live Coding Session 15: Design and deploy voting app on docker

In Live Coding Session 15, we designed and deployed a Voting App on Docker. This application consists of multiple services, and we progressed up to the image build phase, utilizing the services we had previously set up.

#### ðŸ“Œ Application Architecture
The Voting App consists of the following components:

  - **Frontend**: User interface for voting
  - **Backend**: Processes voting requests
  - **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores vote data
  - **Queue (Redis)**: Handles request queuing
  - **Worker**: Processes voting data

#### ðŸš€ Completed Steps
âœ… Designed the Voting App Architecture
âœ… Change Dockerfiles for each service
âœ… Built images and reviewed container structure
âœ… Create Compose file for build and push all service images
âœ… Create Compose file setup and configure service

**Draw a High-Level Design (HLD) diagram of the services built and the path taken**

#### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
In the upcoming sessions, we will focus on full deployment with Docker Compose, managing networking and volumes, and ensuring a stable deployment.

### ðŸ“¢ Stay tuned for the next steps! ðŸš€

In this live coding session, we continued configuring Sonatype Nexus and automated the setup of role and releam and traefik configuration using Ansible. The goal was to create a repeatable and scalable configuration that allows easy repository creation and management.

Features
1. **Created Users and Roles in Nexus:**
   - Configured user access and assigned roles within Nexus for secure access management.
2. **Modified Roles in Nexus:**
   - Updated and managed roles to meet the specific needs of the team and access control policies.
3. **Changed Nexus Password:**
   - Updated the default Nexus admin password to improve security.
4. **Traefik Configuration for Docker Repositories:**
   - Set up Traefik routing for each Docker repository in Nexus to manage HTTP requests and traffic redirection efficiently.

**ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaway:**

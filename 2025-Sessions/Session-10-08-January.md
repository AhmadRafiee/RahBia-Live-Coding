### ðŸ”´ Live Coding Session 10: weâ€™ll finalize the GitLab service setup and automate the manual tasks
In this live coding session, we faced several challenges, and things didnâ€™t go as planned. The main issue was that we jumped straight into implementation without thoroughly understanding the topic, and our knowledge on the subject was insufficient.

Weâ€™ve decided to dedicate more time to this topic next week, address the gaps, and resolve the issues properly. Stay tuned for the follow-up session as we tackle this challenge together! ðŸš€

### ðŸ”´ Live Coding Session 17: Voting App Deployment on Docker with gitlab CI/CD

In Live Coding Session 17, This Session contains the deployment process of the Voting App using CI/CD method, deploy to development stage.

#### ðŸ“Œ Application Architecture
The Voting App consists of multiple microservices that handle voting, result tallying, and backend operations. Initially, the deployment was done manually, and later, we implemented CI/CD pipelines to streamline the build and test process.
The Voting App consists of the following components:

  - **Frontend**: User interface for voting
  - **Backend**: Processes voting requests
  - **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores vote data
  - **Queue (Redis)**: Handles request queuing
  - **Worker**: Processes voting data


#### Technologies Used

  - **Docker:** Containerization of services
  - **Ansible:** Automation of deployment
  - **GitLab CI/CD:** Pipeline implementation for build and test automation
  - **Traefik:** Reverse proxy and load balancing
  - **PostgreSQL:** Database backend
  - **Redis:** In-memory data store for caching and messaging

#### Deployment Steps
  1. CI/CD Implementation
    - Automated service deployment using gitlab CI/CD.


#### ðŸš€ Completed Steps
âœ… Setup Development and production stage with Gitlab CI/CD

**Draw a High-Level Design (HLD) diagram of pipeline**

#### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
In the upcoming sessions, we will focus on full deployment with Docker Compose on production, managing networking and volumes, and pipeline efficiency.

### ðŸ“¢ Stay tuned for the next steps! ðŸš€

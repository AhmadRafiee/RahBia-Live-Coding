### ðŸ”´ Live Coding Session 11: Finalizing GitLab Setup
In this session, we wrapped up the final configurations for GitLab and focused on critical tasks to ensure the service is fully operational and secure. Hereâ€™s what we accomplished:

  **Backup Script Creation:** Developed a comprehensive backup script to safeguard GitLab data.
  **Backup Encryption:** Configured encryption for backup files to enhance data security.
  **GitLab Runner Setup:** Created and registered a GitLab Runner to enable CI/CD workflows.
  **GitLab Finalization:** Completed all pending configurations, ensuring GitLab is ready for production use.

**ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaway:**
This session was all about tying up loose ends and preparing GitLab for real-world application. With a robust backup system and CI/CD capabilities in place, weâ€™re all set!

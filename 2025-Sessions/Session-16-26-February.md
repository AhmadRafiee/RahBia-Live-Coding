### ðŸ”´ Live Coding Session 15: Voting App Deployment on Docker

In Live Coding Session 16, This Session contains the deployment process of the Voting App using a traditional method, followed by an automated CI/CD pipeline for build and testing.

#### ðŸ“Œ Application Architecture
The Voting App consists of multiple microservices that handle voting, result tallying, and backend operations. Initially, the deployment was done manually, and later, we implemented CI/CD pipelines to streamline the build and test process.
The Voting App consists of the following components:

  - **Frontend**: User interface for voting
  - **Backend**: Processes voting requests
  - **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores vote data
  - **Queue (Redis)**: Handles request queuing
  - **Worker**: Processes voting data


#### Technologies Used

  - **Docker:** Containerization of services
  - **Ansible:** Automation of deployment
  - **GitLab CI/CD:** Pipeline implementation for build and test automation
  - **Traefik:** Reverse proxy and load balancing
  - **PostgreSQL:** Database backend
  - **Redis:** In-memory data store for caching and messaging

#### Deployment Steps
  1. Traditional Deployment
    - Manually set up services using Docker Compose.
    - Configured database and cache layers.
    - Verified manual deployment.
  2. CI/CD Implementation
    - Defined GitLab CI/CD pipeline for automated builds.
    - Implemented testing stages before deployment.
    - Automated service deployment using Ansible.


#### ðŸš€ Completed Steps
âœ… Designed the Voting App Architecture
âœ… Change Dockerfiles for each service
âœ… Built images and reviewed container structure
âœ… Create Compose file for build and push all service images
âœ… Create Compose file setup and configure service

#### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
In the upcoming sessions, we will focus on full deployment with Docker Compose, managing networking and volumes, and ensuring a stable deployment.

### ðŸ“¢ Stay tuned for the next steps! ðŸš€

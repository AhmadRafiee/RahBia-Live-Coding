### What We Did
In this live coding session, Automating VM Creation on vCenter with Ansible
Welcome to the fourth live coding session! In this session, we dived into the world of Ansible automation and showcased how to create virtual machines on vCenter seamlessly.

**What We Covered:**
  - Introduction to vCenter and its integration with Ansible.
  - Writing an Ansible role for VM creation and delete.
  - Defining VM specifications (CPU, memory, storage, etc.).
  - Automating the deployment process step-by-step.
  - Debugging and troubleshooting during automation.
  - Writing an Ansible task for ssh config creation and delete.

Managing VMs manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. By using Ansible, you can automate the entire process, save time, and ensure consistency across deployments. This session equips you with the skills to handle vCenter resources like a pro!

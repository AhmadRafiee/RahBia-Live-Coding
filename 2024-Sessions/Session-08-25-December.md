### ðŸ”´ Live Coding Session 8: GitLab Deployment on Docker with Ansible
In this session, we dive into deploying GitLab services on Docker using Ansible. Here's what we covered step by step:

  - **Traefik Configuration:** Updated the Traefik configuration and redeployed it to ensure seamless traffic management for GitLab.
  - **GitLab Container Deployment:** Wrote an Ansible playbook to automate the setup and configuration of the GitLab container from scratch.
  - **Nginx Configuration:** Configured Nginx for improved performance and security.
Backup Configuration: Set up automated backup strategies to secure data and enable disaster recovery.
  - **Authentication Failure Handling:** Implemented bans for failed authentication attempts to enhance system security.
  - **Root Password Configuration:** Configured and secured the root password for the GitLab instance.
This session was packed with practical insights into automating service deployments and implementing best practices for configuring and securing a GitLab instance.

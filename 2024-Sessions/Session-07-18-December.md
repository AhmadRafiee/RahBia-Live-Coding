### What We Did
In this live coding session:

Deploying MinIO and Traefik on Docker with Ansible
we used Ansible to deploy the MinIO and Traefik services on Docker. This covered writing the Ansible playbook, configuring the MinIO and Traefik container, and ensuring everything runs smoothly.

This session is a practical dive into automating server security and deploying scalable services with Ansible and Docker. Perfect for those who want hands-on experience in DevOps automation!

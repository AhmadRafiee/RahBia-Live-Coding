## Session 06:
  - **create iptables rules with ansible**
  - **Setup minio service with ansible**

### What We Did
In this live coding session:

Firewall Configuration with IPTables
We started by configuring IPTables rules using Ansible to manage and secure server traffic. This included setting up rules for incoming and outgoing traffic, ensuring proper access control, and automating the entire process.

Deploying MinIO with Docker
After setting up the firewall, we used Ansible to deploy the MinIO service on Docker. This covered writing the Ansible playbook, configuring the MinIO container, and ensuring everything runs smoothly.

This session is a practical dive into automating server security and deploying scalable services with Ansible and Docker. Perfect for those who want hands-on experience in DevOps automation!

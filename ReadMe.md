# RahBia DevOps Live Coding Series

Welcome to the **RahBia DevOps Live Coding Series**! In this project, we’ll explore the entire DevOps lifecycle—from configuring servers to setting up production-ready services.

### About This Project

This live coding series is designed to guide you through each stage of a DevOps project in a hands-on way. Starting with foundational skills, we’ll gradually move toward complex and advanced setups, such as containerization, orchestration, and cloud infrastructure.

Each session builds upon the previous one, allowing you to develop a deep understanding of each component in a DevOps environment. By the end, you’ll be equipped with the skills to handle a full production deployment.

### What You'll Learn
In this series, you’ll gain hands-on experience in a wide range of essential DevOps skills:

  - **Linux:** Core commands, server setup, and administration.
  - **Networking:** Configuring networks, firewalls, and secure access.
  - **Docker:** Container building, deployment, and management.
  - **Ansible:** Infrastructure automation and configuration management.
  - **Kubernetes:** Container orchestration, workload management, and scaling.
  - **Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing:** Observability practices for efficient troubleshooting and insights.
  - **CI/CD Pipelines:** Building continuous integration and deployment flows.
  - **GitOps:** Git-based workflows for managing infrastructure and applications.
  - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automating infrastructure using code.
  - **OpenStack:** Creating and managing scalable cloud resources.
  - **Ceph:** Distributed storage solutions for high availability and resilience.

By the end of this series, you’ll have a complete toolkit to handle production-ready deployments and optimize DevOps workflows.

### Let’s Work Together!

In this series, we’ll progress side by side, getting hands-on with each topic and learning through experience. Together, we’ll **encounter challenges**, **troubleshoot errors**, and find solutions as we move forward. This journey is all about exploring and overcoming DevOps challenges together!
